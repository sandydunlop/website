# Newsfeed - An RSS News Reader for Minecraft

## Features

This mod adds a news feed to the game that displays the latest news from a configurable source. The mod is designed to be lightweight and easy to use, with a simple interface that allows you to quickly view the latest news headlines. The default news source is set to the BBC World News RSS feed, but you can change it to any RSS feed you like. 

When a new article is published to the feed, a notification will appear in the game. You can view the article by pressing the Newsfeed key (default `N`). The article will be displayed in a GUI that shows the title, description, and a link to the full article. You can also view previous headlines in the GUI.
